// Fira Code: mono-spaced font with programming ligatures

 // From the Fira Code developer
 // Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but thatâ€™s not the case yet.
